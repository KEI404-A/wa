        <ul class="description-list">
            <li>"Gehenna" refers to a location in historical Jerusalem, known as the Valley of Hinnom. It is known as Gehenna in the Aramaic language, which then was translated to the word 'Hell' in the Bible, which is one of the reasons why Gehenna students have devil-like traits such as horns and devil tails.</li>
            <li>Gehenna students exclusively use German-made firearms. This extends to their vehicles as well.</li>
            <li>This also extends to their uniforms taking inspirations from Imperial German Army uniforms, Wehrmacht and Schutzstaffel uniforms, and German Bundeswehr uniforms.</li>
            <li>Gehenna students appeared in a lot of events, either as the main cast or the supporting cast.</li>
            <li>Gehenna was originally supposed to have their own chapter during Volume 3: Eden Treaty. However, plans changed as the team realized they did not have enough time to implement it. Whether this means they will be added to the volume at a later date or recieve their own remains unknown</li>
